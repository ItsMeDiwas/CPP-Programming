/*  Section 7
    Challenge
    
    Write a C++ program as follows:
    
    Declare 2 empty vectors of integers named
    vector1 and vector 2, respectively.
    
    Add 10 and 20 to vector1 dynamically using push_back
    Display the elements in vector1 using the at() method as well as its size using the size() method
    
    Add 100 and 200 to vector2 dynamically using push_back
    Display the elements in vector2 using the at() method as well as its size using the size() method

    Declare an empty 2D vector called vector_2d
    Remember, that a 2D vector is a vector of vector<int>
    
    Add vector1 to vector_2d dynamically using push_back
    Add vector2 to vector_2d dynamically using push_back
    
    Display the elements in vector_2d using the at() method
    
    Change vector1.at(0) to 1000
    
    Display the elements in vector_2d again using the at() method
    
    Display the elements in vector1 
    
    What did you expect? Did you get what you expected? What do you think happended?
